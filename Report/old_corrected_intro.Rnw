  In addition to Resources Selection Functions (RSF) another powerful tool for evaluating data on animal movements and habitat selection are Step Selection Functions (SSF). The latter are used to estimate resource selection by comparing observed habitat use with available structures. Given GPS locations of a collared individual each observation is connected by a linear segment. These segments are considered as steps. The time intervals influencing the step length should be choosen carefully (i.e. by conducting a pilot study) to meet the requirements of the study questions and the target species. The SSF than calculates random steps by taking measured angle and distance along steps and using the observed position as starting points. These alternative positions represent the available habitat beside observed positions. Finally, a comparison of spatial attributes of both, the available and the chosen locations, describes the habitat selection made by animals \cite{thurfjell2014applications}.\\
So far, SSF models were mainly done using Geospatial Modelling Environment (GME) that works with a GIS (www.spatialecology.com/gme/). However, more and more packages for analyzing animal movements are provided in R. Non of these packages is designed for doing a SSF only but different ones provide helpful functions that perform single steps of the Selection Function. Therefore, the aim of this tutorial is to collect all functions necessary to conduct a SSF and order them in a  way that intuitively makes you understand how to run a SSF with your own data. Each step will be explained using an exemplary dataset of GPS locations collected from seven Cougars (\textit{Puma concolor}) in the year 2010 (in the following adressed as \texttt{xmpl}.\\

The initial data needs to be stored in two independent datasets: \begin{enumerate} \item {a raster file of your spatial attributes} and \item{GPS locations of your individuals asigned with a time stamp} \end{enumerate}. The main focus lays on the right site of the workflow, describing preparation of the waypoint data. After loading the table into R you need to create an so-called \texttt{ltraj} object. This data class can be modified if necessary, as random steps should only be calculated for equal time intervals. Accumualtions of relocations with the same time lag can be combined to several "bursts". Each burst has an unique ID (often including an ID for the individual and the time stamp). While there are many options to adjust your waypoint data the raster data describing your spatial attributes needs not much input. Once you created random steps for your observed positions you can extract the spatial attributes for each of those positions by using the fucntion \texttt{extract}. At this point waypoint and raster data will be combined and your final model can be written.

DO WE NEED A EQUATION??

  \displaystyle w(x) = exp(\beta1 x1 + \beta2x2 + ... + \beta p xp)

Why did we not use the data (Wildboar) prepared for the adehabitatLT package? - No information on details, metadata provided, it is hard to understand when to use which dataset and why.
