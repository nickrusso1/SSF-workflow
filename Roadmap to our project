Roadmap to our project:

- Identify literature and other sources of information
    
    GME 
        -> no source code available, only functionality descriptions. Therefore not very useful.
        
    Package hab http://ase-research.org/basille/hab/ 
        -> extension of the adehabitat package
        -> Useful functions in hab: 
            as.ltraj - turns dataset (the animal's path) into an ltraj object
            plot.ltraj - plots trajectories (ltraj objects) of animals through an area
            rdSteps - draws random steps according to given distributions of stepwidth and turning angle
            subset.ltraj - chooses subset of ltraj object based on conditions
            
            What are infolocs?
            What are ltraj objects? / What does the dataset need to look like?
            How to introduce the environmental data into the model?
    
    Package adehabitat
	-> Info:
	    class asc for basic raster data, class kasc for multi-layer maps
	    demo(rastermaps)
	-> useful functions
	    import.asc - import raster maps in ArcInfo ASCII format
	    as.kasc - create multi-layer maps
	    kasc2spixdf - convert to classes of the package
	    area2asc - polygon map to raster map
	    as.traj - 
	    
Developement of adehabitat
	The R package adehabitat provides over 250 functions for the analysis of habitat selection by animals, 
	including functions for

    habitat selection and ecological niche analysis
    home range estimation
    animal trajectory analysis
    working with raster maps along with trajectory data

The functions are divided into four packages:

    HR: Home Range Estimation
    HS: Analysis of Habitat Selection by Animals
    LT: Analysis of Animal Movements
    MA: Tools to Deal with Raster Maps

They are developed by Clement Calenge with contributions from Mathieu Basille (HS, MA), Stephane Dray (LT), Scott Fortmann-Roe (HR), and Manuela Royer (LT).

    Package move
    
    Package sp
    
    Package raster
	-> handling raster data
	-> useful functions
	    rasterize - assign points (coordinates) to grid cells

- List the necessary steps of our project
    
    "hab" or "adehabitat" package should be able to do this:
    
        load telemetry data into R
        fit functions for step length and angle to the data
        choose number of random steps
        draw random points from the fitted distributions
    
    ??? package for the other steps:
    
        load environmental data into R
        get attributes for visited and random points from environmental layers
        Analyze for differences between selected and ignored points
        Apply different SSF's and compare
