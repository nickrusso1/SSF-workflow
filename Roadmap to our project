Roadmap to our project:

- Identify literature and other sources of information
    
    GME 
        -> no source code available, only functionality descriptions. Therefore not very useful.
        
    Package hab http://ase-research.org/basille/hab/ 
        -> extension of the adehabitat package
        -> Useful functions in hab: 
            as.ltraj - turns dataset (the animal's path) into an ltraj object
            plot.ltraj - plots trajectories (ltraj objects) of animals through an area
            rdSteps - draws random steps according to given distributions of stepwidth and turning angle
            subset.ltraj - chooses subset of ltraj object based on conditions
            
            What are infolocs?
            What are ltraj objects? / What does the dataset need to look like?
            How to introduce the environmental data into the model?

- List the necessary steps of our project
    
    "hab" package should be able to do this:
    
        load telemetry data into R
        fit functions for step length and angle to the data
        choose number of random steps
        draw random points from the fitted distributions
    
    ??? package for the other steps:
    
        load environmental data into R
        get attributes for visited and random points from environmental layers
        Analyze for differences between selected and ignored points
        Apply different SSF's and compare
